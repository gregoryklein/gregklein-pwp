			<p><strong>Sam White</strong></p>

			<p>Hiring manager for Zuum, a local bike share startup looking to expand nationally. They recently received $10 million in VC funding and are hiring a full-time, in-house full stack  web developer.

		</div>

		<h3>Technology</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Cell Phone: Samsung Galaxy S9</li>
				<li>Work Laptop: Acer Laptop Aspire 5 (Windows 10 64-Bit, Google Chrome, Intel Core i5, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB SSD, Intel HD Graphics 620, 15.6" screen)</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Scenario</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Views my portfolio site and relevant work to decide whether I'm qualified to redesign and maintain the front and back end of their website.</p>

		<h3>Frustrations and Needs</h3>
			<ul>

				<li>Reluctant to interview candidates who cannot handle both front end and back end web development</li>
				<li>Feels pressured to hire someone who exceeds the job requirements due to shoddy work from contractor/freelance developers hired in the past</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Behaviors and Attitudes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Rarely spends more than 5 minutes on each application because of the high volume of both local and out-of-state applicants</li>
				<li>More likely to hire someone if he's met the developer at a community event, follows them on social media, or was recommended to hire them by a colleague</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Goals</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Sam usually inspects the site's source code for errors and proper formatting.</li>
				<li>Sam checks to see if sites display properly on his Android phone.</li>
				<li>Sam ranks the quality of work in relation to other job applicants' websites in a Google Docs table</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>User Story</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a user, Sam must decide which applicant seems most qualified to remake Zuum's website using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL.</p>
