			<p><strong>Name:&nbsp;</strong>Sam White</p>
			<p><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>35</p>
			<p><strong>Job:&nbsp;</strong>Hiring manager for Zuum, a local bike share startup looking to expand nationally. They recently received $10 million in VC funding and are hiring a full-time, in-house full stack  web developer. This position will require remaking and maintaining their currently buggy site to provide a responsive, more intuitive UX for customers.</p>
			<p><strong>Technology:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Cell Phone: Samsung Galaxy S9</li>
					<li>Work Laptop: Acer Laptop Aspire 5 (Windows 10 64-Bit, Google Chrome, Intel Core i5, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB SSD, Intel HD Graphics 620, 15.6" screen)</li>
				</ul>
			<p><strong>Scenario:&nbsp;</strong>Views my portfolio site and relevant work to decide whether I'm qualified to redesign and maintain the front and back end of their website.</p>
			<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Ignores applicants with poorly formatted or buggy code</li>
					<li>Prefers applicants who specialize in responsive, mobile-first UX</li>
					<li>Reluctant to interview candidates who cannot handle both front end and back end web development</li>
					<li>Feels pressured to hire someone who exceeds the job requirements due to shoddy work from contractor/freelance developers hired in the past</li>
				</ul>
			<p><strong>Behaviors and Attitudes:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rarely spends more than 5 minutes on each application because of the high volume of both local and out-of-state applicants</li>
				<li>More likely to hire someone if he's met the developer at a community event, follows them on social media, or was recommended to hire them by a colleague</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Inspects the site's source code for errors and proper formatting</li>
					<li>Evaluates the website's responsiveness and UI/UX</li>
					<li>Ranks quality of work in relation to other job applicants' websites</li>
				</ul>
			<p><strong>User Story:&nbsp;</strong>As a user, I must decide which applicant seems most qualified to make Zuum's website UX responsive and intuitive using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL.</p>
