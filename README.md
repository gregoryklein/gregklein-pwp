My PWP is a personal portfolio which will use a custom domain (TBD).

## Milestone 1 - Feedback
Good work - your Purpose, Audience, and Goal are clear and concise but could possibly use a bit more detail. For future projects it would be beneficial to include the type of employers/startups who you are attempting to reach with this type of website. Aside from that, the persona is detailed and well-defined. 

Your project files are set up to spec and code looks good. Your Milestone 1 passes at <a href="https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/">Tier III</a>. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2Î±.
