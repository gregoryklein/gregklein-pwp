My PWP is a personal portfolio which will use a custom domain (TBD).

## Milestone 1 - Feedback
Good work - your Purpose, Audience, and Goal are clear and concise but could possibly use a bit more detail. For future projects it would be beneficial to include the type of employers/startups who you are attempting to reach with this type of website. Aside from that, the persona is detailed and well-defined. 

Your project files are set up to spec and code looks good. Your Milestone 1 passes at <a href="https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/">Tier III</a>. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2Î±.

## Milestone 2a - Feedback
Nice work with the wireframes and the content strategy. I like how you're keeping things simple and concise. It's a good way to approach this project. As a reminder, this is a one page site and clicking on links within the site should just move your page to the different sections. It should not load a new page. I like the look of what you're doing here. 

If you are interested in an interactive gallery, I would consider something like [FancyBox3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/)
Additional recommendations:
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for custom typography - it has ~1000 fonts and is easy to integrate.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is a good quality free library for including iconography.

Your Milestone 2a passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin development on your PWP. Looking forward to seeing your project take shape!
